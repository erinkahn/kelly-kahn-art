    <h3>About the artist</h3>
    <p>Kelly is a Birmingham-based artist, specializing in portraits, landscapes, and still-lifes. 
    Hailing from Albertville, in northeast Alabama, she has spent her life expressing herself through art – from 
    copying art out of children’s books while she was still a child herself, to illustrating cookbooks as a teenager. 
    The natural progression was to follow her heart to a career in art.</p>
    <p>She received her BA in Interior Design from Auburn University in 1983 and went on to become a registered interior
    designer in Birmingham. Believing that art can be learned, she’s been teaching fine art and painting since 1999 
    to budding artists of all ages. She has even been commissioned to paint pieces for a variety of organizations including 
    Women’s Club Directories, Indian Springs School landscapes, and portraits of distinguished Alabamians.</p>
